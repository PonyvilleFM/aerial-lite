This is the Liquidsoap Script that is the main backend of 'Aerial Soundwaves' for the radio station PonyvilleFM. This script can be used as a complete autodj, and with minimal editing, can support DJ connections as well as other sources.

You will need at least liquidsoap >=1.2.0 for the FDK support, and it's recommended to install liquidsoap via OPAM to enable the latest libraries.

Naturally, we are not responsible for any fires or server issues, you use this knowing this. This script uses code from Liquidsoap.fm, and has formed the backbone of PonyvilleFM since 2012.
